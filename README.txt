This is the code for "Bones of the Earth", my final project for ITCS1950.  It is a 2D platformer, with 4 levels, 2 enemy types, and a boss.
'MenuDriver.py' is the Driver. The rest are modules.  You need Python and PyGame to run this game.

I made this game in about 40 hours while mostly teaching myself Python and the basics of game development.
